- For Android emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:3000`
- For physical device: `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:3000`

## Usage

## Data Storage

### Local Storage (Android)
- Uses AsyncStorage for offline data persistence
- Automatically syncs with server when available
- Data remains accessible without internet connection

### Server Storage
- JSON file-based storage (easily upgradeable to database)
- RESTful API for data management
- Real-time synchronization between devices

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
Update the categories array in:
- `server/index.js` (backend)
- `web/src/context/ExpenseContext.js` (web)

- Android: Update styles in individual screen files

## Security Considerations

- **Local Data**: All data is stored locally on your device
- **No Cloud Storage**: Data doesn't leave your local network
- **Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions for functionality
- **Offline First**: Works without internet connection

## Troubleshooting

### Android App Issues
- **Permission Denied**: Go to Settings > Apps > Finance Tracker > Permissions
- **Server Connection**: Check that backend is running and IP address is correct
- **Build Errors**: Ensure Android Studio and React Native CLI are properly installed

### Web App Issues
- **API Errors**: Check that backend server is running on port 3000
- **Build Issues**: Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies

### Backend Issues
- **Port Conflicts**: Change PORT in `server/index.js` if 3000 is occupied
- **File Permissions**: Ensure write permissions for data directory
